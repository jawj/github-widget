Ho to install Github Widget on your site
========================================

1) Get the code
----------------

There are two ways that you can get the code :

### Git
This is the recommended way, go to your website's root folder and issue the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/jawj/github-widget.git

### ZIP file
You can also download the latest ZIP file from the following link :

    https://github.com/jawj/github-widget/zipball/master

2) Setting it up
----------------
* Between the head tags in your html files add the following :


<link href='./github-widget/github-widget.css' media='screen' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' />
<script src='./github-widget/github-widget.min.js' type='text/javascript'></script>


If you have adjusted the folder name or script place reflect that on the pathes in the two lines above.

* Go to the place you want to show your github repositories in and paste the following :

<div class="github-widget" data-user="username" style="margin-top: 24px;"></div>

Replace the value of data-user with your actual github username, and you now have a working Github widget.
